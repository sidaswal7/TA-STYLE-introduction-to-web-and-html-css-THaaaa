  <h1 class="heading">Global Warming</h1>
  <p>Global warming is an environmental threat to the entire world that we should know about. The world is being hot day by day because of greenhouse effects and its gas. We, humans, are responsible for this. We should be aware of this. Otherwise, the world will be a place where people wonâ€™t be able to live.</p>
  <p id="special">The level of carbon dioxide is increasing day by day. The biggest reason behind it is deforestation. We need to focus on tree plantation. If you plant more and more trees, it will add oxygen in nature and make the world a better place.</p>
